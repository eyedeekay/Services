[Setup Scripts and Notes for Services I Currently Run](index.html)
==================================================================

### Notes:

 - Requires `docker` and `bash`(Not `dash` or `mksh`, `bash`), as well as an
  I2P router. UDP services require either i2pd or a freestanding proxy capable
  of supporting UDP traffic.
 - SAM is expected to be enabled on the I2P Router for some services, including
  hosting this site with eephttpd.

```bash
