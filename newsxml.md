[News Server: Based on i2p.newsxml](newsxml.html)
-------------------------------------------------

### Notes:

 - This script expects your i2p.newsxml checkout to exist in `$HOME/i2p.newsxml`
  so that it can build the hosting container in that directory.
 - This is the script that relaunches backup news server for I2P I run.
  Nobody else can really use it without the keys, unless they want to set up 
  another news server on a different URL.
 - This doesn't handle generating or signing the news feeds, just hosting them.
  Generate and sign them on one machine, copy them to the host machine, and run
  the update script.

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env sh
cd $HOME/i2p.newsxml
docker build -t i2p.newsxml .
docker rm -f newsxml
docker run -d --restart=always --name newsxml -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 i2p.newsxml
```
